Welcome to the CampingWeGo club website. This page and the others to come will serve as a meeting 
ground for experienced campers to connect with each other. We will do so through our annual group 
camping trips where we will partake in various activities through out the week.
This website will layout the structure of those camping trips as well as show some of the 
sites that we will be visiting. Have a happy time camping with us!
<br>
During 2015, I attempted to try out camping for myself for the first time and while I had fun, 
getting to that fun was rather stressful. I had trouble finding what campsite I wanted to visit,
I was also conflicted over what I wanted to bring with me. While I grew rather frustrated, I ultimately
decided to channel that frustration into creating this website. With this Website active, I hope I can provide
a place for campers to learn and grow from each other. I hope you enjoy it.
<br>
While this website will soon be posted, it will be recieving various updates in the future. 
An example of update will be  the addition of the new days and parts to the schedule. 
Another update will be the graphical changes to the UI's color saturation. We will be taking suggestions
for any further updates.
With all that said, I hope you enjoy the website.
